= Html Test Extension

This plugin adds a bit of functionality and control to the {html_test plugin}[http://github.com/peter/html_test], which must also be installed.

== Mods

* I just set this up to use my defaults without adding any code.  Just existing in the vendor/plugins directory will do this.
* Added verbosity control from <tt>test/test_helper.rb</tt>.  Add the following line to your test_helper if you don't want to see the "validating /SOME_URL with w3c ... OK" lines anymore.
	Html::Test::Validator.verbose = false
* Added revalidation control from <tt>test/test_helper.rb</tt>.  ApplicationController.validate_all = true is NOT really true.  It only validates a url ONCE.  URLs get flagged as already_validated.  Further calls to this url go unvalidated.  If you are testing the same URL under different conditions, ie. with or without user login, with or without items on the page, you aren't getting all that you might expect.  Add the following line to your test_helper to force a validation of ALL requests.
	Html::Test::Validator.revalidate_all = true
	
== ToDos

* I would like to create tests, but the idea of having a plugin dependent on another plugin bugs me a bit.  I don't want to be a hippocrit.  Outside of a rails app, how do you really make testing work?
