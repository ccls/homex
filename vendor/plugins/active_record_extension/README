Minor additions to ActiveRecord::Base

	untaint_column
	untaint_direction

	ignore_articles_in_order_by(column)	#	MySQL specific
	table_status     #	MySQL specific
	auto_increment   #	MySQL specific
	next_id          #	MySQL specific

Nothing too special, but something that I've used often enough to create a plugin rather than continued duplication.
