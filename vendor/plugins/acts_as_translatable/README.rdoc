= ActsAsTranslatable

Adds a few extra columns and adds translation references to itself.


== Notes

I tried using 
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :translations
but it screwed up the validations so I removed it all.
I was trying to validate the presence of a locale
if there was a translatable_id
but since the original isn't saved yet, it would be 
null so the locale wouldn't be forced to exist.
The translatable_id would be added after validation.

== Example
