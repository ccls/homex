= UCB CCLS Engine

This is both a plugin engine and a basic rails app.



== ToDo

I am converting this to a gem, primarily for convenience,
so some things will need changed.

* create a generator and remove the rsync stuff



== Expectations

* ../../aaronchi/jrails or ../jrails plugin

== Required Gems

* {assert_this_and_that}[http://github.com/jakewendt/assert_this_and_that]
* {ruby_extension}[http://github.com/jakewendt/ruby_extension] - modifications, updates and patches for ruby.

== Installation (as a plugin/engine)

 cp config/s3.yml.example config/s3.yml
 # Add your own s3 access keys.  Leave 'test' as it is.

 rake ccls:sync   # can and will overwrite contents in /db/ and /public/

== Testing (as an app)

 rake db:migrate
 rake db:fixtures:load
 rake test
 script/server



== Gemified with Jeweler

 rake version:write
