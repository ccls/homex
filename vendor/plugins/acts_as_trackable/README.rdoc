= ActsAsTrackable

The initial purpose of this plugin is to remove some of the duplicity I had acquired when multiple models were being "tracked."  Whether it be a package shipped via FedEx or a book loaned from a library.  This plugin simply separates this trackability.

== Usage

Generate the migration for holding all of the tracks.

  script/generate track_migration
  rake db:migrate

Generate a migration for something trackable.  I don't know how bad this is needed, but I put a "tracking_number" in all things trackable.

  script/generate trackable_migration Transfer
  script/generate trackable_migration Book
  script/generate trackable_migration Package
  rake db:migrate

== To Do

* Add tests to ensure that it does what it should
* More tests
