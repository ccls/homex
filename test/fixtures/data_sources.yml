#
#	Do not change id, key or description
#		'id' could be referenced by existing data
#		'key' is used in the rails code for searching 
#		'description' is used in javascript ( changing it here will require a corresponding change there )
#
#	Be Advised.  Yaml fixture labels MUST BE UNIQUE.
#		If a label is repeated, only the last one will exist.
#
#	Read about fixtures at http://ar.rubyonrails.org/classes/Fixtures.html
