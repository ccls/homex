ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|

	# The priority is based upon order of creation: first created -> highest priority.

	# Sample of regular route:
	#	 map.connect 'products/:id', :controller => 'catalog', :action => 'view'
	# Keep in mind you can assign values other than :controller and :action

	# Sample of named route:
	#	 map.purchase 'products/:id/purchase', :controller => 'catalog', :action => 'purchase'
	# This route can be invoked with purchase_url(:id => product.id)

	# Sample resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
	#	 map.resources :products

	# Sample resource route with options:
	#	 map.resources :products, :member => { :short => :get, :toggle => :post }, :collection => { :sold => :get }

	# Sample resource route with sub-resources:
	#	 map.resources :products, :has_many => [ :comments, :sales ], :has_one => :seller
	
	# Sample resource route with more complex sub-resources
	#	 map.resources :products do |products|
	#		 products.resources :comments
	#		 products.resources :sales, :collection => { :recent => :get }
	#	 end

	# Sample resource route within a namespace:
	#	 map.namespace :admin do |admin|
	#		 # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
	#		 admin.resources :products
	#	 end

	# You can have the root of your site routed with map.root -- just remember to delete public/index.html.
	# map.root :controller => "welcome"

	# See how all your routes lay out with "rake routes"
