		#	Survey access_code not guaranteed to be unique
		#
		#	As there is no model validation or unique index in the 
		#	database, there is no guarantee that your survey access_code 
		#	will be unique.  It is just a normalized version of your 
		#	survey title.  
		#
		#Running ...
		#<pre>
		# rake surveyor FILE=surveys/kitchen_sink_survey.rb APPEND=true
		# rake surveyor FILE=surveys/kitchen_sink_survey.rb APPEND=true
		# script/console
		# Survey.all.collect(&:access_code)
		#</pre>
		#should show this to be true.
		#
		#This will show both surveys as able to be taken, but will 
		#	only allow the first one when the attempt is made as the 
		#	survey is found by
		#
		#<pre>
		#@survey = Survey.find_by_access_code(params[:survey_code])
		#</pre>
		#
		#In addition, adding a unique index to the db and model will 
		#	make a mess when running 
		#<pre>
		#rake surveyor FILE=surveys/kitchen_sink_survey.rb APPEND=true
		#rake surveyor FILE=surveys/kitchen_sink_survey.rb APPEND=true
		#</pre>
		#as the access_code is not unique and the survey fixtures are 
		#	loaded last, leaving the associations with an invalid survey_id.  
		#	To avoid this, the survey fixture should probably be attempted first.
		#
		#
		#Update...
		#
		#Adding something like ...
		#<pre>
		#def access_code=(value)
		#  counter = 2
		#  original_value = value
		#  while( ( survey = Survey.find_by_access_code(value) ) && 
		#    ( self.id != survey.id ) )
		#    value = [original_value,"_",counter].join
		#    counter += 1
		#  end
		#  super
		#end
		#</pre>
		#... to Survey seems to provide a "fix" for this "problem", 
		#	although I don't know how kosher it is.
		#
		#It works in my test environment, but does not actually work 
		#	in the "rake surveyor" task as the survey is built from a 
		#	different Survey model completely and then loaded into the 
		#	database and not created though the application.
		#
		#My final "fix" was to add 
		#<pre>
		#require 'lib/surveyor/survey_extensions'
		#</pre>
		#to my Rakefile and create the file
		#<pre>
		## > cat lib/surveyor/survey_extensions.rb
		#if surveyor_gem = Gem.searcher.find('surveyor')
		#  require surveyor_gem.full_gem_path + '/script/surveyor/parser'
		#  require surveyor_gem.full_gem_path + '/script/surveyor/survey'
		#end

		#      def initialize_with_unique_access_code(obj, args, opts)

		#        counter = 2
		#        ac = self.access_code
		#        original_ac = self.access_code
