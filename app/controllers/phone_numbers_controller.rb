#Editors can modify the current address and designated it as being an invalid address. If they designated the address as invalid, the why_invalid text field is mandatory.
#
#By default, there is no value for whether an address is valid.
#
#As part of study_subject tracing, we will have the ability to designated whether an address we have has been verified by some means. When an address is verified, the user will set is_verified to true. They will then be required to provide a value for the how_verified field and the system will capture both their user_id in verified_by and the current date in verified_on fields.
