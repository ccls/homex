# Survey On Rails

Surveyor is a rails (gem) plugin, that brings surveys to your rails app. Before Rails 2.3, it was implemented as a Rails Engine. Surveys are written in a DSL (Domain Specific Language), with examples available in the "kitchen sink" survey.

# Installation

As a plugin:

    gem install haml
    script/plugin install git://github.com/breakpointer/surveyor.git -r 'tag v0.9.10'

Or as a gem plugin:
  
    # in environment.rb
    config.gem "surveyor", :version => '>=0.9.10', :source => 'http://gemcutter.org'
  
    rake gems:install

Generate assets, run migrations:
    
    script/generate surveyor
    rake db:migrate

Try out the "kitchen sink" survey:

    rake surveyor FILE=surveys/kitchen_sink_survey.rb

The rake surveyor task overwrites previous surveys by default, but can append instead:

    rake surveyor FILE=surveys/kitchen_sink_survey.rb APPEND=true

# Configuration

The surveyor generator creates config/initializers/surveyor.rb. There, you can specify:

- your own relative root for surveys ('/' is not recommended as any path will be interpreted as a survey name)
- your own custom title (string) for the survey list page
- your own custom layout file name, in your app/views/layouts folder
- your own custom finish url for all surveys. you can give a string (a path), a symbol (the name of a method in ApplicationController)
- if you would like surveys to require authorization via the restful_authentication plugin
- if you would like to extend the surveyor_controller (see Extending Surveyor below)

The initializer runs once, when the app starts. The block style is used to keep multiple options DRY (defaults below):

    Surveyor::Config.run do |config|
      config['default.relative_url_root'] = "surveys/" # should end with '/'
      config['default.title'] = "You can take these surveys:"
      config['default.layout'] = "surveyor_default"
      config['default.finish'] =  "/surveys"
      config['use_restful_authentication'] = false
      config['extend_controller'] = false
    end
    
You can update surveyor's at any time. Use the block style (above), or the individual style:

    Surveyor::Config['default.title'] = "Cheese is great!"

To look at the current surveyor configuration:
    
    Surveyor::Config.to_hash.inspect

# Extending surveyor

Surveyor's models, helper, and controller can be extended from custom modules your app/models, app/helpers and app/controllers directories. To generate the sample files and sample layout, run:

    script/generate extend_surveyor

Any of surveyor's models class_eval, class methods, and instance methods can be modified. Include the following in config/initializers/surveyor.rb:

    require 'models/survey_extensions' # Extended the survey model

SurveyorHelper class_eval and instance methods can be modified. Include the following in config/initializers/surveyor.rb:

    require 'helpers/surveyor_helper_extensions' # Extend the surveyor helper

SurveyorController class_eval, class methods, instance methods, and actions can be modified. Action methods should be specified separately in the Actions submodule. Set the following option in config/initializers/surveyor.rb Surveyor::Config block:

    config['extend_controller'] = true

# Sample layout

      <div id="survey_with_menu">
        <%= yield %>
      </div>
    </body>
    </html>
  
The <code>surveyor\_includes</code> helper just calls <code>surveyor\_stylsheets + surveyor\_javascripts</code> which in turn call:

    stylesheet_link_tag 'surveyor/reset', 'surveyor/surveyor', 'surveyor/ui.theme.css','surveyor/jquery-ui-slider-additions'

    javascript_include_tag 'surveyor/jquery-1.2.6.js', 'surveyor/jquery-ui-personalized-1.5.3.js', 'surveyor/accessibleUISlider.jQuery.js','surveyor/jquery.form.js', 'surveyor/surveyor.js'
    
# Dependencices
